# Notes on completing the token task

- When a token is created, you usually need to use the ABI and the address to interact with it later.
- When creating a liquidity pool, Uniswap provides a clean and simple interace. This is not a general reccomendation for their services.
- Using uniswap you have to go into advanced setting and change to testnet mode to create a liquidity pool.
- You should be asking youself, what is a liquidty pool? are their other ways to distribute tokens? What am I setting and why?
